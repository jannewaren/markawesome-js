## [Unreleased]

### Added

- New `tree` transformer producing Web Awesome's `<wa-tree>` / `<wa-tree-item>` from a **nested Markdown bullet list** — a byte-for-byte mirror of the Ruby `TreeTransformer` (parity locked by new `tree-zip` / `tree-invoice` / `tree-alt-per-node-expanded` cases in `test/parity-corpus.test.ts` plus exact-string assertions in `test/tree.test.ts`). It runs last in the pipeline (after `accordion`).
  - **Static-only scope**: the tree's `selection`/`lazy`/`selected` features are interactive (need JS) and are skipped entirely; we emit a display/navigation-only tree (nesting, initial expand state, leading icons).
  - **Primary syntax**: a single `||||||` (6 pipes) open fence wrapping a normal nested Markdown list, closed by `||||||`. **Block alternative**: `:::wa-tree … :::`.
  - **Fence token** `open` (alias `expanded`) marks every branch node `expanded`; **per-node leading tokens** (stripped from the label): `expanded` forces one branch open and `icon:name` emits a leading content `<wa-icon name="name">` with no `slot`. **WA runtime caveat** (verified against the WA 3.9.0 kit): `<wa-tree-item>` only honors a static `expanded` on items visible at load, so `open` expands the **top-level** branches and deeper branches stay collapsed until opened (WA strips `expanded` from nested items at init). The attribute is still emitted on every branch — harmless, records authorial intent, and forward-compatible.
  - The indentation parser keeps list lines (`-`/`*`/`+`), measures leading-whitespace width (tab = 4 columns), and nests by comparing actual indent values, so 2-space and 4-space lists both work. Labels are plain text (HTML-escaped), so colon-bearing labels like `cbc:ID` are safe. `expanded` is emitted only on nodes that have children AND (fence open OR the node's own flag); leaves never get it. The Ruby→JS regex translation follows the documented rules (`gm` flags, `[\s\S]*?` for the newline-spanning body, `\|{6}`). (No `renderAsMarkdown`, matching the rest of this engine.)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- New `video` transformer producing Web Awesome's two media components — `<wa-video>` (a single embedded video) and `<wa-video-playlist>` (a playlist of `<wa-video>` children). A byte-for-byte mirror of the Ruby `VideoTransformer` (parity locked by `test/parity-corpus.test.ts` and exact-string assertions in `test/video.test.ts`); it runs in the pipeline immediately after `comparison`.
  - **Single video**: `;;;<tokens>` … `;;;`. **Playlist**: a `;;;;;;<tokens>` container wrapping bare `;;;` items (mirroring the carousel `~~~`/`~~~~~~` structure). Block alternatives `:::wa-video` / `:::wa-video-playlist`.
  - **Body**: the first markdown link `[text](url)` → `title`/`src`; the first markdown image `![alt](url)` → `poster` (a negative lookbehind keeps the image from being read as the link). A block with no link is left untransformed.
  - **Tokens**: `controls:none|standard|full`, `preload:auto|metadata|none` (enum-validated, invalid values dropped), and the boolean flags `autoplay`, `autoplay-muted`, `autoplay-on-visible`, `loop`, `muted` (whole-token matched). The playlist forwards `controls` to the container only; children omit it. Emission order, HTML-escaping, and the "no link ⇒ untransformed" guard match the Ruby engine exactly. (No `renderAsMarkdown`, matching the rest of this engine.)
- New `date` transformer producing Web Awesome's two declarative timestamp components — `<wa-format-date>` (an absolute, locale-formatted date) and `<wa-relative-time>` ("3 days ago", optionally live-ticking). A byte-for-byte mirror of the Ruby `DateTransformer` (parity locked by `test/parity-corpus.test.ts`), it runs in the pipeline right after `tooltip`.
  - **Inline syntax** (primary): `[[[ <date> <tokens> ]]]` — triple square brackets, single-line, transformed before the host markdown processor.
  - **Block alternative**: `:::wa-format-date <date> <tokens>` / `:::wa-relative-time <date> <tokens>` with an empty body closed by `:::`; the selector name chooses the mode.
  - **format-date**: `style:`/`time:` presets (`short|medium|long|full`) expand to granular WA attributes, with granular overrides (`weekday`, `era`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, `second`, `hour-format`, `time-zone-name`, `time-zone`, `lang`/`locale` → `lang`) winning per key. Enum values validated; unknown/invalid tokens dropped. A bare date defaults to `style:long`. Deterministic emission order matches the Ruby engine exactly.
  - **relative-time**: `format` (`long|short|narrow`, default omitted), `numeric` (`auto|always`, default omitted), `sync` (boolean), `lang`/`locale` → `lang`. The `relative` flag switches the inline form into relative mode.
  - The ISO 8601 date/datetime token (omitted ⇒ runtime now) is escaped into `date="…"`. Like `<wa-icon>`, both components render generated text into shadow DOM with no light-DOM fallback.
- Aligned placements + `skidding` for the `popover` and `tooltip` transformers, and a per-tab `disabled` flag for `tabs` — a byte-for-byte mirror of the Ruby engine (parity locked by `test/parity-corpus.test.ts` and an exact-string assertion per transformer). `<wa-popover>`/`<wa-tooltip>` now accept all twelve Web Awesome placements (the four primary plus the eight aligned variants `top-start`, `bottom-end`, …) and a `skidding:N` token (offset *along* the target; negative allowed) alongside the existing `distance:N` (offset *away*). A leading `disabled` token on a `+++ ` tab item header (e.g. `+++ disabled Coming soon`) emits `<wa-tab disabled>` and strips the flag from the label, leaving non-disabled tabs byte-identical. Emission order matches the Ruby engine exactly.

### Fixed

- **Block components nested inside a container's item body are no longer wrapped in a `<p>`**, restoring byte-for-byte parity with the Ruby engine. The internal renderer (`src/markdown.ts`) uses markdown-it, which — unlike the Ruby engine's Kramdown — did not recognise an already-transformed `<wa-callout>` (etc.) as an HTML block and wrapped it in a paragraph. So a callout nested in an accordion item rendered as `<wa-accordion-item …><p><wa-callout>…</wa-callout></p>` in the Node engine but `<wa-accordion-item …><wa-callout>…</wa-callout>` in Ruby. The stray `<p>` was also user-visible: in the browser it auto-closes *through* the custom element and ejects the nested component's body, so the component rendered **empty**. A new markdown-it block rule (`src/wa-block-rule.ts`) treats block-level `<wa-*>` components as pass-through HTML blocks, matching Kramdown. New parity-corpus cases (callout nested in accordion / card / tab panel / details) lock the Ruby-identical output, and `test/markdown.test.ts` covers the rule directly. Pre-existing cosmetic whitespace divergences (blank lines *between* sibling blocks, list `<li>` indentation) are unchanged — they render identically and were already accepted divergences.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-26

Initial release — a TypeScript port of the markawesome Ruby engine (parity
target `markawesome` 0.16.0).

### Added

- `process(content, options)` pipeline mirroring the Ruby transformer order
  exactly (layout → popover → tooltip → badge → button → callout → card →
  carousel → comparison → copy-button → details → image-dialog → dialog → icon →
  tag → tabs → accordion), with internal fenced-code-block protection.
- All 17 component transformers: callout, badge, button, tag, icon, card,
  copy-button, comparison, details, dialog, popover, tooltip, layout, tabs,
  carousel, accordion, image-dialog.
- `configure()` / `getConfiguration()` / `resetConfiguration()` global config
  (callout icons, custom components).
- Internal markdown-it renderer tuned for Kramdown parity (`xhtmlOut`, no
  smart quotes, Kramdown-style heading auto-ids).
- Deterministic MD5 ids for dialog/popover/tooltip, byte-identical to the Ruby
  engine.
- Dual ESM + CJS build with bundled type definitions (tsup); Vitest suite;
  cross-engine parity corpus.

### Known divergences from the Ruby engine

- Cosmetic only: markdown list-item indentation and the wrapping of a standalone
  raw `<img>` differ between markdown-it and Kramdown. The rendered HTML is
  visually identical.

### Deferred

- `renderAsMarkdown()` / plain-markdown rendering parity (Phase 3) is not yet
  ported.
